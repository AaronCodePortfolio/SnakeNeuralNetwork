# SnakeNeuralNetwork
 
This is a very old project and my first attempt at machine learning.  Because it was my first attempt I always try to take on a project by doing all the research I can without looking at someone else's code.  The only exception was using someone else's fitness calculation.  Because of this, I did a very poor job.  It still does work just not very well.  In its current version it runs 100 families of snakes through 100 generations each and then creates a new family out of the top performing snake out of each family.  Because I built this all just from an understanding of how a neural network works but not how they are properly made I took an object-orientated approach to create the networks.  Since then because of the further research I had to perform for the convolutional neural network project, I now understand I should have been using matrix tables to speed everything up.  Currently, the main issue with this project is it is set up to run only one snake at a time making it incredibly slow.  Ideally, if I were to remake this project I would look into multithreading to run snakes at once and remove the visual aspect of moving objects in unity almost entirely.  Despite all that, this is still one of the projects I am most proud of because of how much I managed to create myself instead of just following someone else's tutorial.
